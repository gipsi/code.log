* Started [Coursera Gameification](https://www.coursera.org/learn/gamification)

* Did the [Bartle test](http://4you2learn.com/bartle/)

Thought about:

* yak shaving [“A Guide to Yak Shaving Your Code” @FirehoseProject](https://medium.com/@firehoseproject/a-guide-to-yak-shaving-your-code-d30f98dc759)

* And building a [bike shed](http://bikeshed.org)
  * and reading [A generation lost in the Bazaar](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=2349257)
* 2017-01-21 css 5/50 Favourite animated animal ... Fiver from Watership Down.  Definitely too cold to code. 
 *  2017-01-20 css 50 tiger.  Too cold to code really, worried the eqipment might pack up.  Got 4th image done though.

 My Codepen gipsi page is now a [_Web Design_System_](https://codepen.io/gipsi/full/VmzPJg/ * 2017-01-19 Trying new markdown editor on pc whilst constructing image of a beaver in css)
 
  [/* A decent markdown editor finally available on Windows */](https://typora.io/#windows)
  
   Other things I found that I'm going to read 
 * [ Atomic Design by Brad Frost](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)
  * [The Cathedral & the Bazaar by  Eric S. Raymond](https://library.oreilly.com/book/9780596001087/the-cathedral-amp-the-bazaar/8.xhtml?ref=toc#cathbazrev-SECT-1.1)
 * [The jargon file](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/)
 
 * 2017-01-19 css beaver (3rd image in challenge).
 
 * 2017-01-18 Determined to make css image on phone I made an elephant.  I can only get better at this! This article on Flat design [“Flat Design. History, Benefits and Practice.” @tubikstudio](https://uxplanet.org/flat-design-history-benefits-and-practice-c2b092955f14) gave me some infill on the style. The contrast with skeumorphics is interesting.  

* Another area I like to delve into and put an article into 'pocket' for later is [How to write Agile User Stories by Josh Grayson](https://gorillalogic.com/blog/how-to-write-agile-user-stories/?utm_content=44695328&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter)

*  2017-01-17  Very inspired by this chapter on colour theory of Rune Madsen's book [Programming Design Systems](https://programmingdesignsystems.com/color/a-short-history-of-color-theory/?utm_source=Programming+Design+Systems&utm_campaign=bf03f75c71-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2017_01_15&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_a2d6a1e779-bf03f75c71-120128697) There are things in this brief chapter that spark a quite different way of thinking about colour.  Complimentary is [A Dao of Web Design](http://alistapart.com/article/dao) An exellent prompt for considering how web design has evolved from print but is a very different medium.  It includes the wonderful word palimpsest, which I had to look up, so my new word of today!  It reminded me of [this page](https://bryanrieger.com) which I saw yesterday.Started reading a tutorial phone app book about PHP - my first encounter.
Meanwhile thinking about crafting a CSS image for CodePen challenge.
First go with VR game - dystopian, terrifying.

*  2017-01-16 Reading phone app  css tutorials and trying a few basic things.  Joined CodeWars.

* 2017-01-15
Getting ready for CSS 50 day challenge. 
First go with VR head set. Deep sea descent.

* 2017-01-14 [UX Honeycombe on Peter Morville's blog](http://intertwingled.org/user-experience-honeycomb/)
He calls it Interwingled, I love the word and will explore the concept some more.

Another lesson from Jeremy Kieth's Resilient Web Design Chapter 6 Steps

" Here’s a threestep approach I take to web design:

Identify core functionality.Make that functionality available using the simplest possible (Web) technology.Enhance!"

* 2017-01-11  Most important thing I learned today was the difference between declarative and imperative languages. The  declarative languages html and css can still run in the browser with the odd mistake. The imperative languages, programming languages 'proper' come to a halt with any mistake. (ch 4. Languages. The Resilient Web)   
I've been hovering, before proceeding to learn JavaScript but there is much still to learn of html and css.

* 2017-01-07 Sorting out 100DaysOfCode log page. Forked from the wrong repo, then made updatelog.md branch and deleted the repo and started again.  Not sure about the status of the updatelog.md file I made.


* 2017-01-06 Added two files to this repo to make links to each month and tidy up readme landing page.  New code editor (by TechOrion based on Maskyn)on phone to do drafts and view markdown makes editing easier.

* 2017-01-05 Trying to figure out if I can switch off Jekyll Theme and Use ony html/css and also thinking about reversing this (bullet list) so I write at the top, and put in chapters (blog style).
