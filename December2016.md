A Blog about my Coding Journey

Hello git!

2016-12-01 I'm going to get to know more about you.

2016-12-02 I'm going to visit every day.

2016-12-03 I finished the git-it challenges. Had a go with forks clones and branches and collaborated with a robot! @reprorobot ~ meow!. Pushed and pulled stuff from posh~git, which worked despite a bright yellow "WARNING" that told me "Powershell 2.0 is deprecated; you have version 2.0". ... Two options ... download version 3.0 or supress the warning. I took the third option and just left the warning at the top of the shell.

2016-12-04 Started Chrome Dev Tools Course, an Edx Thinking Mathematics course and some more git 1.add a line to readme.txt and save file again 2.in posh~git: git diff 3.git status 4.git add readme.txt 6.git commit -m updated readme.txt

again again! ... again

changed this file to .md from .txt

2016-12-16 today I'm reading web book by Jeremy Kieth on Resilient Wb Design about making websites
making a commit for #commitmas on Android with laggy WiFi is tricky and time consuming but possible 🙆

git push origin/master

2016-12-17 Got rather lost with posh-git terminal. git bash, git-it-electron. Consulted Stack Overflow and used git mergetool and git gui. ... and thank you Git! (For giving me this helpful notepad text message)

Please enter the commit message for your changes. Lines starting

with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts the commit.

On branch master

Changes to be committed:

new file: HelloCodeSchoolProject

new file: gipsi.github.io

new file: hello-git

modified: readme.txt

Changes not staged for commit:

modified: hello-git (new commits, modified content)

Part of my problem stemmed I think from changing this readme file from .txt to .md and then deleting the .txt from the remote repository. There was a conflict "further up the working tree" which I spent some time trying to fix (an hour++)
eventually reinstating the file seemed the easier option. Lesson learned: be careful what you commit.

2016-12-18 Decided to change the way I write dates with the help of this article:

Doing more exercises in the Git Shell ... still not happening with commiting from there, but I am learning to navigate better after some practice with Appendix A: Command Line Crash Course part of Learn Python the Hard Way by Zed Shaw

2016-12-19 Set Jekyll Theme Leap Day in GitHub Pages for gipsi.github.io +another daily commit for Commitmas-3

2016-12-20. Pull merge commit practice for Commitmas-3. and yes, focusing on Git more than code. hence text file.

Tried to apply Jekyll Theme to The Bootstrap Template I've been using in CodePen. Really I just want to get get pages up and running and not sure which file in the repository it uses. 24ways.

2016-12-21 some GitHub Essentials with Mozilla Science Lab

2016-12-22 Forked Commitmas and Pybluedot got NASA authentication key and ... A lesson in Markdown  

2016-12-23 GotGitHub Pages Theme to work by deleting other files in the repo that seemed to be getting in the way.

First Day of Commitmakkuh

2016-12-24 Commitmakkuh day 1. markdown and update readme. (on Android)

2016-12-25 Commitmakkuh day 2. Put brackets round links. A commit.

2016-12-26 Commitmakkuh day 3. No Commits today but I did read up on some Git essentials on my phone.

2016-12-27 Commitmakkuh day 4. Sorting out this page with the help of this page about Markdown (also converts it rather usefully to HTML). Switched Themes a few times now I can do it. Got links to work (the brackets have to be RIGHTnext to each other). Details!!! I always end up reading a bit of background stuff to what I'm learning. I am quite sad to read about Aaron Swartz who with John Gruber brought us Markdown

2016-12-28 Commitmakkuh day 5. Another update for this readme. Preparations to start #100DayOfCode on Jan 3rd.     this time I'll keep be able to write about it on Github yay!!!     Catching up with Javascript30 challenge

    Some more lessons in Markdown: This is bold and italic

Header six

2016-12-29 Commitmakkuh Day 6 finally worked out that  Hash symbol must be at the start of the line with no spaces  To make a heading.

  another update: Hash displayig correctly on github, but not with Jekyll templates.    

2016-12-30  commitmakkuh day  7   Programming and design     “Should a Programmer Learn to Design?” @ux_app

2016-12-31 Commitmakkuh day 8

Last day of 2016 has been a journey. Daylight hours involved sorting out guttering and drainage pipes, being chased by wild horses and moving firewood logs.  

The weather - dull and damp, slightly above freezing with fog threatening to close in over a murky sunset.

When I got a WiFi connection I sat down with a cup of tea and my phone, caught up with emails messages and chat which left me mulling over thoughts about meetups with other learners. Being a mature learner in a rural location with a low travelling budget usually prevents me from entertaining the idea for long, but the humor and positivity of this article “My 411 days’ Journey to FCC Front End Certification — 10 days after I turned 74.” @maheshupadhyaya my attention yesterday and today I derected some resonance in my mind of the benefits.

After navigating to #Commitmas repo to review challenge I went to YouTube to choose a vBrownBag video to learn some GitHub. I picked Contributing to OpenSource Projects. then on to explore GitHub Explore where I was drawn to Vanessa Mozzadrellas Project about the hugely increased availability of online educational resources. This led me to https://github.com/mozzadrella/Informal-Tech-Project and then to P2PU - Peer to peer University where there's loads of Free Courses, tools and contacts for Facilitators and learners.

https://learningcircles.p2pu.org/en/courses/

The site got me once again considering meetups and P2PU's Learning circles

Tools to set up a website for a learning circle seems worth looking into as well as Udacity course How to Make A Website with Html and CSS, and an *Acumen course on Storytelling.

I'll finish up today with some words from Jacqueline Novogratz video:

"Commit to something bigger than yourself and you'll find it'll set you free ..."

The loud explosive sound of fireworks is a prompt ...

GoodBye 2016

I'll remember you for what came to be your  many sad endings,for me  the last days I'd have with some very dear friends.

Happy New Year GitHub

Welcome 2017

I look forward to your new beginnings, new adventures and new stories.
