  Node.js, NPM, Gulp, Grunt, winSCP

A recce of NPM, Node.js, Grunt and Gulp. And some tinkering with html/css/JavaScript Mozilla Thimble project Random Excuse Generator - coder(remix) I thought of some better excuses.

  Reasearching what I need to code for the FreeCodecamp Wikipedia Viewer project took me through looking at other campers examples,
  reading an article on Medium then an MDN JavaScript Tutorial.  I like the walkthrough of this and read the page about JSON which 
  I got a better understanding of immediately.  
  The 'How to make a website' nature of the tutorial looks helpful for my ongoing website project so decided to do some of that.
